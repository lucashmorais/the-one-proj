\section{Introduction}

In this document we present evaluations on how mobility and communication
patterns affect the behavior of a set of routing protocols. We selected the
VANETs (Vehicular ad hoc networks) for cars and buses mobility patterns in the
city of Helsinki, Finland.  We obtained those patterns and the routing
protocols we used from the The ONE (Opportunistic Network
Environment)\footnote{\url{https://akeranen.github.io/the-one} [Accessed in
July 09, 2017]} simulator. We designed our experimental settings on the simulation of
DTNs (Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks) based on the methodology used by
Juyal et al. \cite{juyal2015message}.

We present a performance evaluation of wireless transmission protocols used in
the experiments. The following sections discuss in detail each experimental
setting and the results we obtained. The code we wrote for the experiments, the
data we generated and the report are all hosted at GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lucashmorais/the-one-proj} [Accessed in
