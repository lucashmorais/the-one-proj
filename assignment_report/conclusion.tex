\section{Conclusion}

This report presented evaluations VANETs implemented as DTNs for car and bus
scenarios simulating the city of Helsinki, Finland.  The tests we performed
described when each routing protocol should be used for several different
scenarios involving car and bus VANETs. For this scenario the results show that
the EpidemicOracleRouter should be the routing protocol of choice whenever
available message buffers are not too small and higher network utilization is
not a great concern.  For Bus VANETs scenarios our results show that the
EpidemicOracleRouter should also be the routing protocol of choice provided
message buffers are not too small.
