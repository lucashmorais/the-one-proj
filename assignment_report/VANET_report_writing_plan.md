## Report writing plan

#### What to answer
##### About transmission performance
1. What is the most important parameter for improving **delivery probability**?
2. Which routing protocol delivers best **delivery probability** vs. **overhead ratio** relationship?
3. Which protocol is able to deliver messages with the **lowest latency**?

##### About how we measured things
1. What simulation parameters combinations did we test?
2. What did we make for making sure that the hosts really behaved as cars would?

##### Regarding the different protocols
1. What are the main differences among all the used protocols?

##### Deeper analysis
1. What could be done for improving **delivery probability** in scenarios with no more than a few hosts?
2. What were our expectations regarding all the different parameter combinations we used?
